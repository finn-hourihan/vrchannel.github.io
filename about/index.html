       <!-- we often tread the same path for so long that the thought of deviating feels like it would result in catastrophe.
        the paralysis of boredom has always distorted my vision. i used to think that every minute passing me by was
        another mile between me and what i desire. the comfortability of doing nothing 
        there is a distortion within everyone; an invisible hand that guides

        everything is mystifying. 
        
        hunting for your dream
        
        "honestly, im not sure what it is"

        revel in the gift of the net.

        the sentiments that bind us are the same sentiments that 
         
         let us join in vivid realization. writing yourself off is getting easier every day.
         the spirit of creation. 
         'vr channel' is a haven for those who have chosen.-->
